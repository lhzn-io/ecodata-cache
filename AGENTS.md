# Ecodata Cache Agent Guide

This file is the canonical, vendor-neutral entry point for agent
guidance in this repository.

## Scope

- Prefer standards and shared conventions over vendor-specific agent layouts.
- Treat `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/` as the primary instruction surface.
- Keep agent-specific files as thin compatibility shims when needed by a tool.

## Tool Discovery Map

- Canonical source of truth: `AGENTS.md` and `/.agents/`.
- Claude Code:
  - Compatibility shim: `/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- VS Code GitHub Copilot Agent:
  - Compatibility shim: `/.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Rule for all tool-specific files: redirect to this file and
  `/.agents/`, and only add minimal tool-local behavior.

## Repository Focus

Ecodata Cache is a Python microservice that fetches, harmonizes, regrids, and serves
real-time and historical coastal boundary conditions, initial conditions, and structural
nudging telemetry to the `coastal-sim` Julia physics engine.

## Core Rules

- **Dependency management**: Always use `uv run` - never `pip install` directly.
- **Linting/formatting**: Run `uv run pre-commit run --files <files>` (ruff + mypy)
  before staging any changes.
- **Testing**: Run tests with `uv run pytest tests/unit/` (unit) or
  `uv run pytest tests/integration/` (live API).
- **Commits**: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
  No AI attribution footers.
- **Git staging**: Stage files explicitly (`git add <file>`). Never `git add .`.
- **Never commit without approval**: Present the proposed change set and commit message
  to the user and wait for explicit confirmation before running any `git commit`.

## Domain Constraints

- **Grid normalization**: Elevations and water levels are positive up. Normalize
  external dataset quirks at the fetcher tier - never let them propagate into the
  dispatcher or regridder.
- **OPeNDAP access**: Use the `pydap` engine (`engine="pydap"`) for all THREDDS/OPeNDAP
  endpoints. Prefer `.csvp` endpoints for tabular time-series to avoid NetCDF overhead.
- **C-grid stagger**: NYOFS (POM) uses an Arakawa C-grid. Interpolation to rho-points
  must be done in the fetcher before returning data to the dispatcher.
- **Tidal Harmonics**: HYCOM provides subtidal OBCs. The service provides raw GOT4.10c (default) or EOT20 harmonic constituents (amplitudes, phases) via `fetchers/tides_tmd.py`.
- **Precision**: Output arrays should default to `float32` (`<f4`) and use Little-Endian
  endianness for compatibility with `Zarr.jl` and `Oceananigans.jl`.

  and gotchas

## Compatibility

If a tool only reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or another
vendor-specific file, that file redirects here and adds only the minimum compatibility
details required by that tool.
